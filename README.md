# ADS-JMS - Audio Data Storage

currently it can generate `WAV` files using `generatewav.py` file with different sampling rates and frequencies.

still need to implement error detection methods such as CRC

## Usage

To install the needed packages, type `pip install -r req.txt` (or use `pip3` for python3).

## To-Do

 - Create header to distinguish filetypes and frequencys used
 - Figure out maximum usable frequency
 - Figure out maximum usable sample rate
 - Figure out usage of multiple channels
 - Implant data stream into audio file
 - Extract data stream from audio file
 - Error Detection (only applicable to decoding)
 - (Potential encoding and decoding)
